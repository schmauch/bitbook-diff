# bitbook-diff
This php class will take two strings and return a html diff of them with the &lt;ins> and &lt;del> html tags representing what was deleted and inserted. It makes it easy to visually compare strings.

It is a slightly modified version of the script I found on https://www.bitbook.io/how-to-diff-two-strings-in-php-and-show-in-html/
